This combines each element of departments with the corresponding element in changeTracker.
AllEntities into a tuple. 
The result is a sequence of tuples, where each tuple contains an element 
from departments and the corresponding element from changeTracker.AllEntities.

Resulting Sequence of Tuples:
The resulting sequence will look something like this:

[(departments[0], changeTracker.AllEntities[0]), (departments[1], changeTracker.AllEntities[1])]

Here, departments[0] is paired with changeTracker.AllEntities[0], and departments[1] is paired with changeTracker.AllEntities[1].

Iteration:

foreach (var (original, copy) in departments.Zip(changeTracker.AllEntities))

The foreach loop iterates over each tuple in the zipped sequence.
On each iteration, original refers to an element from the departments array, and copy refers to the corresponding element from changeTracker.AllEntities.
Modifying and Checking References:


original.Id = -1;

Console.WriteLine(ReferenceEquals(original, copy));

original.Id = -1; changes the Id of the original Department object to -1.

ReferenceEquals(original, copy) checks if original and copy refer to the same object in memory.
Since changeTracker.
AllEntities likely contains copies of the departments array, ReferenceEquals(original, copy) should return false.
