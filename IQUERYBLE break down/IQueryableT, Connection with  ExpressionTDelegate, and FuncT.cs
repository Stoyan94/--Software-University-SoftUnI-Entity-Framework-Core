IQueryable<T>, Expression<TDelegate>, and Func<T> are closely related in the context of LINQ and querying data sources in C#. Here's how they are connected:

IQueryable<T>

Definition: IQueryable<T> is an interface that extends IEnumerable<T>. 
    It is used for querying data from a data source where the query can be composed and translated into the native query language of the data source(e.g., SQL for databases).

Purpose: Enables building and executing queries that can be optimized by the data source (e.g., a database).

Expression<TDelegate>
Definition: Expression<TDelegate> represents strongly typed lambda expressions as expression trees. 
    These expression trees can be parsed, modified, and translated into other forms (e.g., SQL).

Purpose: Allows LINQ providers to inspect the structure of the query, translate it into a format suitable for the data source, and optimize it for execution.

Func<T>
Definition: Func<T> is a delegate type that represents a method that can be executed.
              It is used to represent lambda expressions and anonymous methods that can be executed directly.

Purpose: Used for in-memory method execution, such as filtering, projection, or any other operations on collections.

Connection between IQueryable<T>, Expression<TDelegate>, and Func<T>

1. Query Composition with IQueryable<T>
When you build a LINQ query using IQueryable<T>, the methods like Where, Select, OrderBy, etc., expect expressions of type Expression<Func<T, bool>> or similar expression types, rather than Func<T>. 

This is because:

Example:

IQueryable<Product> query = context.Products
                                   .Where(p => p.Price > 50)
                                   .OrderBy(p => p.Name);
Here, p => p.Price > 50 is an Expression<Func<Product, bool>>, not a Func<Product, bool>.

2. Expression Trees in IQueryable<T>
The expression trees (Expression<Func<T, bool>>) are used by the LINQ provider to understand the structure of the query. 
  The provider can then translate this tree into a native query language (e.g., SQL for databases).

Example:

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> predicate = p => p.Price > 50;
IQueryable<Product> query = context.Products.Where(predicate);

The Where method takes an Expression<Func<Product, bool>> which can be translated into SQL by the LINQ provider.

3. Execution with Func<T>
When dealing with in-memory collections (IEnumerable<T>), you can use Func<T> directly because the query will be executed in-memory without the need for translation into another query language.

Example:

Func<Product, bool> predicate = p => p.Price > 50;
IEnumerable<Product> products = productList.Where(predicate);

Here, Where method takes a Func<Product, bool> and executes the filtering in-memory.

Summary of the Connection

IQueryable<T> uses Expression<TDelegate> to build queries that can be translated and optimized by the data source.
Expression<TDelegate> represents the structure of the query in a form that the LINQ provider can analyze and convert.
Func<T> is used for in-memory execution and cannot be translated into other query languages by a LINQ provider.

Practical Example
Consider a scenario where you are querying a database using Entity Framework:

using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

public class Product
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Product> Products { get; set; }
}

public class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        using (var context = new AppDbContext())
        {
            // Using IQueryable with Expression<Func<T, bool>>
            Expression<Func<Product, bool>> expr = p => p.Price > 50;
            IQueryable<Product> query = context.Products.Where(expr);

            // The query is not executed until enumeration
            foreach (var product in query)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{product.Name} - {product.Price}");
            }

            // Converting Expression<Func<T, bool>> to Func<T, bool> for in-memory filtering
            Func<Product, bool> func = expr.Compile();
            var filteredProducts = context.Products.ToList().Where(func);

            foreach (var product in filteredProducts)
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"{product.Name} - {product.Price}");
            }
        }
    }
}
In this example:

Expression<Func<Product, bool>> expr = p => p.Price > 50; is used to build an expression tree that can be translated into SQL.

IQueryable<Product> query = context.Products.Where(expr); represents a query that will be executed on the database.

Func<Product, bool> func = expr.Compile(); converts the expression into a delegate that can be executed in-memory.
